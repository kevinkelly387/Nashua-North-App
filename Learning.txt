GIT STUFF (in case you forget [i did])
1. "git pull" very important bc you can update yourself on everything
2. "git commit" commits your changes to the local git repository
          adding "-m "your comment"" will add a comment to your change
3. finally "git push" updates the repository

 "git rm the.file" to remove files
"git add the.file" if you have added a file to the folder
