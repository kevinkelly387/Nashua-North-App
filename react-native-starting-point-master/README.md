# react-native-starting-point

A small repo with ESLint + Flow + Prettier ready to go for `react-native` - release `0.46.4`.

## Based on

I gave my spin to these sources:

* [Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Flow in VS Code for React Development](https://hackernoon.com/configure-eslint-prettier-and-flow-in-vs-code-for-react-development-c9d95db07213)
* [Brent Vatne's eslint-config-react-native-prettier](https://github.com/brentvatne/eslint-config-react-native-prettier)

And added [flow-scripts](https://github.com/yangshun/flow-scripts) to remove the warnings from node_modules.
